# Humana-Mayes-Healthcare-Competition--2021

2021 Problem Statement
Increasing the COVID-19 vaccination rates among Humanaâ€™s members continues to be a priority both for member and the larger population health and safety considerations. Humana is particularly focused on providing vaccination opportunities for the most vulnerable and underserved populations. Existing disparities in health equity have become very visible during the vaccine response to COVID-19.
Humana and many others have reduced real barriers to gaining access for those who want the vaccine. In addition, a portion of the members, like in the general population, are hesitant or resistant to get the vaccine due to a combination of factors that include, misinformation, and lack of trust in the vaccine. It is believed that these members will require personalized outreaches involving clinical conversations to build trust in the vaccine. However, member level vaccination status data is incomplete due to lack of consistent and timely data capture at the vaccination sites.
Using the provided data and potentially supplementing with public data, create a model to predict which members are likely to be hesitant so that Humana can design targeted outreaches for these members, prioritized to reach the most vulnerable and underserved populations to receive health solutions.



* ROC curves generated & AUC metric will be calculated
* Disparity Score and corresponding weighting will be calculated utilizing RACE & SEX


Boosting alogirthm is developed to predict if a patient is hesitant to covid vaccination using Medical Claims Features, Pharmacy Claims Features, Lab Claims Features, Demogrpahics, Credit data, Condition Related Features, CMS Features etc.
